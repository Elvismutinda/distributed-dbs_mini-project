<br />


Individually or in a group of at most two, create a distributed heterogeneous database environment comprising three sites with three different participating database platforms, and at least two different operating systems.

Use the above environment to demonstrate your grasp of fragmentation and reconstruction. Think of a domain area comprising of at least four distributed relations. Write out your applications/reports and use them to perform fragmentation. Write out the applications/reports into calculus queries. Come up with appropriate query access frequencies of your choice. After working out the fragmentation, allocate the fragments by implementing them physically in the participating databases. Choose one of the sites to be the decision site and perform reconstruction using either views, functions, stored procedures or any other technique.

## Domain - Ecommerce

_The company Soi is an online retailer that sells a variety of products such as clothing, electronics, books, and home appliances.Nitras wants to use a distributed database to store and manage its inventory, orders, customers, and suppliers across 3 different counties._

| 3 sites | 3 different Database Platforms | at least 2 Operating Systems | hostnames |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Machakos (Decision site) | PostgreSQL | Windows | machakos_site |
| Nairobi  | MySQL | Linux | nairobi_site |
| Makueni | MariaDB | Linux | makueni_site |

## Docker Setup

A docker-compose file was used to create containers for each site and initialise the databases by creating the tables and defining the relations.

The containers are interconnected over a bridged docker network that I called `soi_network`

To run the databases services, run the following commands in your terminal

### Build the postgres Dockerfile

```bash
docker compose build
```

### Spin up the containers

```bash
docker compose up
```

> You can optionally add -d flag to run it in detatched mode
> ```bash
> docker compose up -d
> ```
> If you run in detatched mode, use:
> ```bash
> docker compose logs -f
> ```
> to view the logs

### Stop the containers

```bash
docker compose down
```

> If you want to also remove the volumes and network, use the -v flag:
> ```
> docker compose down -v
> ```

## Accesing database terminal
### PostgreSQL

```bash
docker exec -it machakos_site psql -U elvis87 -d soishop

# automatically enters the soishop database using the "-d soishop"
# if it doesn't use this:
\c soishop;
```

### MySQL

```bash
docker exec -it nairobi_site mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u elvis87 -p

# once the terminal is open, switch to the database
USE soishop;
```

### MariaDB

```bash
docker exec -it makueni_site mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u elvis87 -p

# once the terminal is open, switch to the database
USE soishop;
```

## Applications

- Application 1 - Find the name and price of the cheapest product in each category
- Application 2 - Find the email and name of the customers who have ordered more than 3 times
- Application 3 - Find the total number of products in stock for each supplier

### Application 1 - Find the name and price of the cheapest product in each category

Horizontally fragment the inventory table category wise

Simple predicates → `category`

Category = {Clothing, Electronics, Books, Toys, Furniture}

m1: Category = Clothing <br>
m2: Category = Electronics <br>
m3: Category = Books <br>
m4: Category = Toys <br>
m5: Category = Furniture <br>



```sql
--
-- Makueni
--
SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE category_id = 2; -- Electronics

SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE category_id = 5; -- Furniture


--
-- Nairobi
--
SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE category_id = 1; -- Clothing

SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE category_id = 4; -- Toys


--
-- Machakos
--
SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE category_id = 3; -- Books
```

### Application 2 - Find the email and name of the customers who have ordered more than 3 times

Horizontally fragment the customers table orders wise

Simple predicates → `orders_count` > 3

m1: Orders_count > 3 <br />
m2: Orders_count <= 3



```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE orders_count > 3;

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE orders_count <= 3;
```

### Application 3 - Find the total number of products in stock for each supplier

Horizontally fragment the inventory table supplier wise

Simple predicates → `supplier`

m1: Supplier = Supplier A <br />
m2: Supplier = Supplier B <br />
m3: Supplier = Supplier C <br />
m4: Supplier = Supplier D <br />
m5: Supplier = Supplier E



```sql
SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE supplier_id = 1; -- Supplier A


SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE supplier_id = 2; -- Supplier B


SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE supplier_id = 3; -- Supplier C


SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE supplier_id = 4; -- Supplier D


SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE supplier_id = 5; -- Supplier E
```

## Query Execution Frequencies

|     | Machakos | Nairobi | Makueni | Total |
| --- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| Q1  |    0     |   8     | 8       | 16    |
| Q2  |    8     |   10    | 5       | 23    |
| Q3  |    0     |   15    | 7       | 22    |

## Application Views

### category_cheapest

```sql
CREATE VIEW category_cheapest
AS

-- Create a subquery to get the lowest price for each category
WITH min_price AS (
  SELECT category_id, MIN(price) AS price
  FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_makueni
    UNION ALL
    SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_nairobi
    UNION ALL
    SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_machakos
  ) AS inventory_all
  GROUP BY category_id
)

-- Join the subquery with the fragmented tables to get the name and price of the cheapest product in each category
SELECT i.category_id AS category, i.name AS item, i.price
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_makueni
  UNION ALL
  SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_nairobi
  UNION ALL
  SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_machakos
) AS i
JOIN min_price AS m
ON i.category_id = m.category_id AND i.price = m.price
ORDER BY i.category_id;
```

### triple_customers

```sql
CREATE VIEW triple_customers
AS
SELECT id, email, name FROM customers_orders_gt_3;
```

### supplier_products

```sql
CREATE VIEW supplier_products
AS
-- Combine the fragments using UNION ALL
WITH combined_inventory AS (
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_A
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_B
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_C
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_D
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_E
)

-- Calculate the total quantity for each supplier
SELECT
    'Supplier A' AS supplier,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_products
FROM combined_inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 1

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Supplier B' AS supplier,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_products
FROM combined_inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 2

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Supplier C' AS supplier,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_products
FROM combined_inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 3

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Supplier D' AS supplier,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_products
FROM combined_inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 4

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Supplier E' AS supplier,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_products
FROM combined_inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 5;
```

## Reconstruction

These are the views that have been implemented in the decision site.

### Application 1

```sql
-- Reconstructs the inventory table that was fragmented category wise

CREATE VIEW inventory_c_reconstructed AS
-- Combine the fragments using UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT * 
FROM inventory_makueni
UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT * 
FROM inventory_nairobi
UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT * 
FROM inventory_machakos;
```

### Application 2

```sql
-- Reconstructs the customers table that was fragmented orders wise

CREATE VIEW customers_reconstructed AS
SELECT * 
FROM customers_orders_gt_3
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM customers_orders_lte_3;
```

### Application 3

```sql
-- Reconstructs the inventory table that was fragmented suppliers wise

CREATE VIEW inventory_s_reconstructed AS
-- Combine the fragments using UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_A
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_B
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_C
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_D
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_E
) AS combined_inventory;
```
